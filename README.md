Contributions are very welcome. Please provide suggestions :)

If you'd like to suggest modifications (e.g. resource addition, deletion, new categories etc.), please be sure to do so by opening pull requests (check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) if you don't know what it is) or create issues (check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) if you don't know how to do).

This list is not supposed to be comprehensive. It is curated and only focuses on "awesome" content, i.e. the goal of this list is to have a low noise-to-signal ratio.

Surely, "awesomeness" can be subjective, but some basic rules can be applied to know what is worth listing or not, for instance:
- Is this resource/project truly informative/improving on the status quo?
- Would the community benefit from knowing this resource?
- Is this resource well written/implemented?
- etc.
